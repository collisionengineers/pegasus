# INTK-066 execution — current state

## Preserved history

Operator approved splitting the oversized execution log on 8 September 2026. Original version `c6871c457b830386` contained 70,088 characters. All original content, including every failure, deviation and disposition, is preserved in order:

1. [History 1](execution-history-1.md)
2. [History 2](execution-history-2.md)
3. [History 3](execution-history-3.md)
4. [History 4](execution-history-4.md)

Each file has explicit boundary comments. Removing only the opening/closing envelope lines and concatenating the four enclosed segments reconstructs the original string exactly. This was checked against read-back content before replacing the current log. Do not trim segment whitespace.

## Current handoff

INTK-066 remains Implementing in its recorded worktree and branch. Last frozen source head begins e843; full exact identity and evidence are in history 4. Latest verifier returned IDLE after solution build (zero warnings/errors), 56 fixture tests and 140 browser tests passed, with no failures/skips in those completed test runs. Prior failures remain preserved; these passes are not post-merge proof. Canonical host owner remains DELIV-053 scratch/execution, returned IDLE by the verifier; re-read before future grants.

Operator explicitly requested removal of only QdosExtractionCoverageTests.cs (unsupported extraction-percentage gate), retaining exact-value, routing and classification tests. That deletion has NOT occurred. A fresh ready execution packet is required before resuming source work, followed by recording the scope disposition and remaining verification. No INTK-066 push, PR, merge or deployment has occurred. PLAT-046 PR 711 is separately in Review; do not absorb its scope.
