## (b) Follow-up tickets

Minted in `docs/tickets/backlog/` with `research-link` → this review. IDs assigned at mint after a
fresh status-folder rescan.

| Plan id | Ticket | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | TKT-238 | Corpus subset-address merge (platform) |
| T2 | TKT-239 | `-002`/`-003` registration suffix for concurrent image-first cases (intake; relates TKT-193/172/177) |
| T3 | TKT-240 | Incident-date + principal eliminators (intake; realignment R5) |
| T4 | TKT-241 | Odometer vision reader + DVSA cross-check (enrichment; activates the TKT-152 tier) |
| T5 | TKT-242 | Network-drive VRM scan channel (intake) |
| T6 | TKT-243 | Code/docs hygiene: `dedup.ts` header, ADR-0023 mis-citations, `A.`/`AP.` comments, PCH `AP.` allowlist, `locValue` residue |
| T7 | TKT-244 | Triage vocabulary code additions (email; behaviours live in TKT-188/184/186) |
| T8 | TKT-245 | Service-trust seam: decide/harden `withServiceAuth` (platform/security) |
| T9 | TKT-246 | Platform ADR backfill 0026–0030 as one ticket (operator drafts/approves the decisions) |

Already existing, deliberately not re-minted: TKT-068 (assistant attach), TKT-154/218 (MCP lane),
TKT-057 (`A.`/`AP.` flow — D1b ruling recorded), TKT-162 (nested audit folder), TKT-219/220/221/222
(retro).

## (c) TKT-206 riders — dangling ADR-0017 citations

ADR-0017 is deleted by this review; its number citations remain in code, infrastructure, and ticket
records **by design** (no `done/` ticket record is ever edited). TKT-206 must sweep them when it drops
the retention architecture:

- `apps/web/src/.../case-detail.controller.tsx:462`
- `services/data-api/src/.../activity-routes.ts:117`
- `packages/domain/src/dto/index.ts:138`
- six `services/functions/*/infra/main.bicep` retention parameters
- `docs/architecture/data-protection.md` — rework the two-clock section; **rider: the rework must
  RETAIN the DSAR cross-store coverage list** (PostgreSQL, source/transient bytes, Archive, mail
  references, File Request links, identifier strings) — after 0017's deletion it is the only home of
  that enumeration
- ticket records citing 0017: TKT-160, TKT-217 (leave as history; TKT-206 notes them)
