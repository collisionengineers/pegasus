# Architecture decision records

ADRs capture durable decisions and consequences. They do not duplicate live resource state, ticket
progress, branch history, or incident diaries.

Changing an accepted decision requires a new ADR or an explicit superseding amendment. Exact live state
belongs in [LIVE_FACTS.json](../../LIVE_FACTS.json).

## Conventions

- **Status vocabulary:** `Proposed` / `Accepted` / `Amended (dated)` / `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` /
  `Withdrawn`. Build state lives in the body with plain TKT references, never in the Status line.
- **Amendments** use dated headings of the form `## Amendment — <topic> (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
- **Relationship clauses** ("refined by", "extends", "supersedes", review provenance) sit in the
  Status line.
- An ADR links the current documents that realize it; those documents carry a one-line
  "Decision of record: ADR-NNNN" back-link.
