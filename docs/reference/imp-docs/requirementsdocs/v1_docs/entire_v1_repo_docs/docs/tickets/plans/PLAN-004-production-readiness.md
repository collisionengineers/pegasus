# PLAN-004 — Production readiness and lifecycle completion

## Outcome

Complete the pre-release product around reliable intake, canonical case identity, evidence handling,
Archive behavior, handler-facing workflows, security and production reconciliation.

## Decisions

- Ticket acceptance and current live evidence determine readiness; merged code alone is not proof.
- Stable HTTP contracts, database identifiers and persisted numeric codes change only in an explicitly
  scoped member ticket.
- Production writes require separate, named authorization and do not follow from plan membership.
- Archive writes remain confined to approved scope and every byte-changing action needs reversible,
  hash-backed evidence.
- TKT-216 owns the EVA submission route/body defect. Repository cleanup may not hide or absorb it.

## Delivery groups

1. Governance, access and control.
2. Canonical case data, save behavior and readiness.
3. Evidence and Archive foundations.
4. Photo decisions and image checks.
5. Identity, numbering and duplicate resolution.
6. Intake, email correlation and classification.
7. Handler-facing convergence.
8. Approved production reconciliation.

## Close-out

Every member must be independently verified. Blocked tickets remain visible with their unavailable input
or authorization named; they are never treated as complete by plan aggregation.
