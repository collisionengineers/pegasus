# Verification — TKT-066: Assistant can't find a case by spaced registration + tool failures are invisible

## Verdict
TESTED (offline)

## Evidence
- `packages/domain/src/domain/vrm-canon.test.ts` — canonicaliser + three-call-site agreement.
- `services/data-api/src/features/assistant/chat-client.test.ts` — tool-throw retry + `toolErrors` surfaced.
- `services/data-api/src/features/assistant/chat-routes.test.ts` — SELECT-only guard; canonical-VRM `lookup_case` query shape.
- `node verify-all.mjs`: domain + API + SPA + orch gates green (only the pre-existing environmental
  parser pytest fails; no Python touched).

## Pending / gaps
- Built DARK: `ASSISTANT_TOOLSET_V2` defaults **off**; the widened read adapter is inert until flipped.
- **Not deployed.** Live proof (deploy `cespk-api-dev` → flip the gate → spaced-VRM lookup on a live case,
  e.g. `YT13 UTV`, resolves; a forced tool failure shows in App Insights) is pending the operator flip in
  [docs/tickets/BOARD.md](../../BOARD.md) (§F — PLAN-001).

## How to re-verify
Offline: `npm --prefix packages/domain test`, `npm --prefix services/data-api test`, `node verify-all.mjs`. Live (after
flip): ask the assistant for a case by a spaced registration; confirm it resolves and that an induced tool
error appears as a warn trace in App Insights.

## Verdict update — 2026-07-09 (ticket-verifier dispatch)

FAILED live on first flip — a REAL defect the verifier root-caused to the source line: with ASSISTANT_TOOLSET_V2=true every assistant chat 400s at AOAI (schemas.ts zodToJsonSchema openApi3 target emits boolean exclusiveMinimum for the .positive() limit fields; AOAI requires draft-2020-12 and rejects the whole tools array — the surface was down, including earlier questions). The canonicaliser ITSELF is deployed and working (the global-search route resolves spaced YT13 UTV to QDOS26053/26029). MITIGATION: the orchestrator flipped the gate back OFF (readback false — earlier assistant restored); the schema fix + re-flip is folded into the in-flight final-wave batch. Acceptance lines 2/4/5 hold (source/offline); lines 1/3 re-probe after the fix.

Verified by: ticket-verifier dispatch, transcribed by the orchestrating session, 2026-07-09.

## Verdict update — 2026-07-10 (final sweep, ticket-verifier dispatch; transcribed verbatim)

**PENDING — the 07-09 FAILED is cleared:** the zod `exclusiveMinimum` root-cause fix (`normalizeExclusiveBounds` ×4) is in the deployed build lineage and `ASSISTANT_TOOLSET_V2=true` re-flipped (az readback today; registry records the 07-09 re-flip with 0 "Invalid schema" traces/6h). `assistantChat` live + 401 fail-closed today. Lines 2/4/5 held per the 07-09 verdict. Remaining tail (operator-shaped): a live authenticated chat resolving `YT13 UTV` + a forced tool failure showing the warn trace + `toolErrors ≥ 1`. Queued SQL (shared with 069): `ai_usage_ledger` rows surface=assistant since 07-09 — rows would prove authenticated chats complete post-re-flip. Verified by: ticket-verifier dispatch, 2026-07-10.

### W7 data-pass note (orchestrator-run, 2026-07-10)
The ai_usage_ledger shows **4 authenticated assistant calls completed 2026-07-09** (one staff
actor, gpt-5) — post-re-flip chats ARE completing (the precondition your queued ledger SQL was
checking). The YT13 UTV probe + forced-tool-failure observability remain.

## Verdict

PENDING

## Evidence

- Targeted tests passed: `assistant.test.ts` and `aoai-chat.test.ts`, 26/26.
- Canonical matching is implemented for VRM and Case/PO while claimant/reference retain
  case-insensitive substring matching: `assistant.ts:261-266,283-289`.
- Persistent failure handling performs one retry, increments `toolErrors`, and emits the exact warning
  format: `aoai-chat.ts:210-218`; pinned by `aoai-chat.test.ts:65-66`.
- Transient first-failure recovery is pinned with no surfaced error and `toolErrors=0`:
  `aoai-chat.test.ts:85`.
- Audit-lite records `toolErrors`: `assistant.ts:541`.
- Live API is Running; `AI_CHAT_ENABLED=true`, `ASSISTANT_TOOLSET_V2=true`, and `assistantChat` is
  registered.
- The deployed signed-in SPA loaded successfully and the assistant completed a real read-tool request.
- Read-only SQL invariant is pinned across all read tools: `assistant.test.ts:45-52`.
- Repository remained clean; `HEAD` and `origin/main` both equal
  `308294c45c83cc692873fda2f1e82babb3403618`.

## Pending / gaps

- The required live three-form VRM and spaced/compact Case/PO equivalence matrix was not completed.
- No live persistent-failure trace was captured. Fresh one-hour App Insights queries returned no
  `[assistant]`, `assistantChat`, or `toolErrors` rows, so the warning plus `toolErrors>=1` acceptance
  cannot be certified live.
- The transient retry behavior is proven offline only, not against the deployed service.
- `ASSISTANT_WRITE_TIER_ENABLED=true` is now live, contrary to the registry's “absent/off” statement.
  Source inspection shows `propose_action` only captures a proposal and executes no SQL
  (`assistant.ts:167-184`), but the registry drift needs reconciliation.

## How to re-verify

- In the signed-in deployed SPA, query `YT13 UTV`, `yt13 utv`, and `YT13UTV`, then repeat with a known
  spaced/compact Case/PO and capture identical case results.
- Trigger a controlled read-tool failure and capture both the exact warning trace and the corresponding
  audit-lite row with `toolErrors>=1`.
- Trigger a controlled one-shot transient failure and confirm the retry succeeds with no user-visible
  error and `toolErrors=0`.
- Reconcile the live write-tier setting with the registry before transcribing a final verdict.

## Confidence + unread surfaces

High confidence in the source, offline retry/error tests, current live gates, registered route, and one
successful deployed read. Unread live surfaces are the canonical lookup matrix and controlled
failure/retry telemetry.
