# Changes — TKT-154: Add a constrained MCP path for registration-based image ingestion

## Status
Deployed to the development database, Box façade, Data API and orchestration on 2026-07-16, deliberately
dark pending the dedicated principal and standard-client live proof.

Rebased onto post-#99 `main` (base `ae3bdb48`) on 2026-07-15 and remediated against a four-lane review
(see "Rebase + review remediation" below). Head/base bind to the actual PR #73 branch tip and base
`ae3bdb48`; the retired reciprocal-AI PR-review workflow (removed on `main` by TKT-149) is not the
review authority.

## Changes made

- Added a dedicated app-only MCP principal split. The write identity must carry exactly
  `CollisionSpike.ImageIngest`; delegated, missing-role and multi-role tokens fail closed.
- Added MCP 2025-06-18 initialization/version negotiation, Streamable HTTP media checks, Origin
  validation, protocol-version responses, JSON-RPC envelope validation, notification handling,
  structured tool errors and refusal of JSON-RPC arrays/concurrent batch writes.
- Added registration-only lookup/upload tools. The client cannot supply a case or Archive folder id.
  The canonical registration is rechecked under a transaction-scoped registration lock before any
  Blob write, eliminating lookup-to-bind ambiguity/reassignment races.
- Reused the TKT-165 evidence upload seam with stable idempotency, content hashes, per-file outcomes,
  agent audit records, image-classifier handoff and readiness recomputation.
- Added pre-parse HTTP body admission, cumulative Base64 decoded-size preflight, strict image bounds,
  and a durable Postgres per-client request counter (`196_mcp_image_ingest_rate_limit.sql` plus the
  live delta/RLS/grant changes).
- Added a strict Box write-scope attestation route. Unset, mismatched and out-of-root scope locks fail
  closed. Agent evidence repeats `requiredWriteRootId=392761581105` at the asynchronous Archive upload,
  immediately before bytes leave the Box façade.
- Sanitized public results: no evidence UUIDs, backend exceptions or Archive retry errors. Unknown
  write outcomes preserve retry-safe per-file receipts; readback failure retains a durable receipt.
- Hardened the image-classifier instruction against text/QR/metadata prompt injection and added an
  adversarial visible-text image fixture.
- Updated the sample folder watcher to perform the full MCP lifecycle, send the required headers and
  release each sequential batch before assembling the next.
- Updated the architecture and gated runbooks with the Box lock, downstream orchestration gates,
  schema/deploy order and standard-client proof requirements.

## Second audit hardening

- Replaced the strict Box path's cached ancestry reuse with a fresh `path_collection` read on every
  autonomous attestation, immediately before upload. Regression coverage verifies that a folder first
  accepted under the test root and then moved outside it is refused without a second byte upload.
- Replaced `Content-Length`-dependent admission with a byte-counted Web `ReadableStream`. Missing length
  on chunked/HTTP2 requests cannot bypass the cap; a runtime with no bounded stream is refused.
- Added official MCP SDK runtime schemas plus a durable `mcp_http_session` table. Initialize mandatory
  fields, request ids, request/notification/response distinction, initialized notification shape,
  negotiated protocol and first-interaction ordering are now enforced across Function scale-out.
- Replaced the SVG prompt-injection fixture with a real accepted PNG and carried it through the mocked
  classifier HTTP seam. Live-model behavior remains explicitly pending.
- Made the sample watcher call and verify `tools/list` before its first `tools/call`.

## Third audit hardening

- Made the sample watcher capture the server-issued `Mcp-Session-Id` from `initialize` and send it on
  `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, lookup and upload. A wire-level behavioral test runs the
  watcher against a server that returns 404 when the session or protocol header is missing.
- Aligned session failure responses with MCP 2025-06-18: missing/malformed headers remain HTTP 400;
  valid-format session IDs that are absent, expired, not ready, or do not match the authenticated
  principal/protocol return HTTP 404.
- Bounded durable lifecycle state per authenticated principal. Creation takes a principal-scoped
  transaction advisory lock, reuses only that principal's expired rows, defaults to a hard eight-row
  cap, and returns retryable HTTP 429 at capacity. The schema now indexes principal plus expiry.

## Pull-request review hardening

- Kept `error`-status evidence recovery available to staff while refusing the autonomous image lane
  on that state. Removed the registration path's table-wide lock. The binding predicate now takes the
  same registration advisory key as Case eligibility-changing triggers and deliberately takes no Case
  tuple lock while it holds that key, avoiding the row-lock/advisory-lock AB/BA cycle.
- Proved the numbered canonical MCP table files run before the shared forced-RLS policy pass in
  `900_constraints.sql`; the live delta retains equivalent explicit policies.
- Restored an explicit live-backend `app.role=staff` assertion before the dual-principal route reaches
  its rate-limit, session or tool tables; HTTP authorization alone is never treated as a DB role.
- Added the standard initialize/initialized session lifecycle to delegated read-only route coverage
  and made migration-before-API ordering an explicit protection for the already-live read lane.
- Kept lookup and upload eligibility aligned by excluding `error` cases from the autonomous lookup,
  while staff evidence recovery remains available. Added explicit no-response coverage for MCP
  cancellation notifications (the handler already followed that contract).

## Fresh post-rebase security and concurrency review

- Bound delegated sessions only to the staff user object/subject and app-only sessions only to the
  calling application id. The two identity namespaces never fall back to each other; a token missing
  the identifier required for its lane now fails closed before any database query. This prevents all
  users of one shared interactive MCP client from sharing a session namespace.
- Normalised autonomous filenames to NFC and stripped control, bidirectional and zero-width formatting
  characters so a filename cannot visually disguise its extension or label.
- Restricted the sample watcher's directory scan to actual regular files. Directory and symlink-shaped
  entries are ignored rather than followed as candidate images.
- Re-reviewed the registration serialization, canonical evidence/idempotency seam, forced RLS policies,
  Box test-root attestation, asynchronous root recheck, classifier prompt boundary and conservative
  durable/readiness responses after the rebase.

## Rebase + review remediation (2026-07-15)

Rebased onto post-#99 `main`; the redundant "remove reciprocal-AI review workflow" commit was dropped
because `main` already retired it (TKT-149). A four-lane review then drove these fixes:

- **Session/body robustness (api).** `initializing` MCP sessions now get a short distinct TTL
  (`MCP_SESSION_INIT_TTL_MINUTES`, default 2) and the per-principal cap evicts the oldest
  initializing/expired slot, so an agent crash-loop can no longer wedge the ingest lane at HTTP 429.
  The `readonly_staff` MCP path now uses a bounded body reader (`MCP_READONLY_MAX_HTTP_BODY_BYTES`,
  default 1 MiB) instead of an unbounded `json()`.
- **Classifier plate-OCR preservation (orchestration).** The shared classifier prompt's
  untrusted-in-image-text guard is now scoped to instruction/command/request text with an explicit
  carve-out requiring legible number plates to still be transcribed; a prompt-content lock and a
  clean-plate seam regression guard against silent OCR suppression. Live-model proof stays gated.
- **Schema/migration hygiene.** The tkt154 delta was renamed to `2026-07-13-…` so it sorts after its
  `tkt165` dependency; canonical `195` CHECK constraints are named to match the delta; the per-row
  `case_` registration advisory-lock budget is documented beside the trigger and in the architecture
  doc (bulk-writer batching follow-up **TKT-217**), with an API-before-orchestration deploy-order note
  (**TKT-218**).
- **Ticket-evidence integrity.** Removed the reciprocal-marker head/base binding and the phantom
  reciprocal-review test suite from the evidence, and refreshed every count against a full offline
  gate re-run on the rebased-and-remediated head.

Note: the `staff_evidence_upload.attempt_count` / `last_attempt_at` increment added by this PR runs on
the shared bind path for **all** upload sources (not only `mcp_agent`) — an intentional, low-cost
observability change to existing staff uploads, not scoped narrowly.

## Deliberately not done here

- No Entra role/client/service-principal creation or assignment.
- The implementation/review branch made no live change. The later PR #100 release applied the already-
  reviewed additive schema and deployed the services dark; it made no Box write or Outlook mutation.
- No real authenticated standard-client/Box/classification/readiness proof. Those remain the live
  verification gate and are recorded in `verification.md`.
- No live-model prompt-injection proof; only the deterministic raster/seam regression was run offline.

## 2026-07-20 — gate flipped live by explicit operator direction (TKT-159 audit)

- `MCP_IMAGE_INGEST_ENABLED=true` and `MCP_IMAGE_INGEST_BOX_ROOT_ID=392761581105` were set on
  `cespk-api-dev` (settings backed up first; app confirmed `Running`, 144 functions, no new 5xx after the
  recycle). `BOX_FOLDER_ROOT_ID` was already `392761581105` live, so `mcpImageIngestConfigured()`
  (`services/data-api/src/features/cases/mcp-image-ingestion.ts:101-107`) now evaluates true.
- **Confirmed still safe/inert for any real caller**: the write lane is additionally gated by
  `principal === 'image_ingest_agent'` in `services/data-api/src/features/assistant/mcp-routes.ts`, which
  requires a token carrying the dedicated `CollisionSpike.ImageIngest` Entra app role
  (`services/data-api/src/platform/auth/staff-auth.ts:168`). Per this ticket's own "Deliberately not done
  here" above, that role has never been created or assigned to any principal, so the env-var flip alone
  does not open the lane to any actual client — every caller still fails closed on principal resolution.
- This flip does **not** complete TKT-154's acceptance. The "Pending / gaps" list in `verification.md`
  (dedicated role creation, standard-client end-to-end proof, live classifier/OCR proof) is unchanged and
  the verdict stays `PENDING`. `LIVE_FACTS.json.safetyGates.mcpImageIngestion` updated with a dated note.
