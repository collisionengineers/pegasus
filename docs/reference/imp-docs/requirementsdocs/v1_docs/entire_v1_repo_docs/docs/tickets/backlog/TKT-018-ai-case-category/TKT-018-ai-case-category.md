# AI VLM total-loss vs repairable categorisation (deferred)

## Problem
An AI VLM to assess damage and categorise whether a case is a total loss vs repairable. **Explicitly
deferred** until the pipeline is fully complete.

## Evidence
This is the most downstream AI capability and depends on the suggestion layer (TKT-015) and image
analysis (TKT-016) being in place first. Operator marked it deferred. Keep in `backlog`.

## Proposed change
(Deferred) — once the pipeline is complete, add a damage-assessment VLM that suggests total-loss vs
repairable as an observation for handler confirmation.

## Acceptance
Deferred; revisit after the core pipeline + AI suggestion layer land.
