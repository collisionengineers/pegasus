# Images-received / report-chaser email misrouted (scope to confirm)

## Problem

Authored 2026-07-02 from raw evidence only — this folder was dropped without a note. The folder name
says **images-received**, but the evidence is a **report chaser** carrying an images PDF for an
existing case (`Ref 160404 / GN14GBE`): a provider mail that should route to its **existing case**
(attach the images evidence + archive) rather than sit unlinked or mint anything new.

**Scope to confirm with the operator at Phase-2 kickoff:** whether this ticket is (a) the
images-on-an-existing-case routing failure (overlaps TKT-034's matched-case arm), (b) another
thread-scope chaser misclassification (overlaps TKT-030), or (c) both on the one sample.

## Evidence

- `RE Ref160404_GN14GBE_Nissan Qashqai Tekna_Mr Louis Cannell - Chaser for engineers report.eml`
- `images - cvd.pdf`

## Delivery

Phase 2 of the [Rules Engine v2 plan](TKT-043-misclass-images-received.md)
(`case_update` lane + `images_received` subtype); the sample joins the eval corpus either way.

## Status update — 2026-07-02 (next — taxonomy + policy built; this sample still misses; needs D7 + gates)

The `case_update` category and `images_received` subtype exist in the authored taxonomy-v2 DDL delta
(`84fb102`, [docs/tickets/BOARD.md](../../BOARD.md) §D7) and the case-update/suggested-attach machinery is built
(the same `triagePolicy`/`ai_suggestion`/SPA-tab stack as TKT-023/TKT-041 —
`7bac2ee`/`00980d5`/`9fb16cf`/`69ec02e`). **Honest gap:** this ticket's own sample (`RE
Ref160404_GN14GBE_... - Chaser for engineers report.eml`, manifest id `tkt043-images-existing-case`) is
joined to the eval corpus with expected `case_update`/`images_received`, but **still scores a miss**
(`category_correct: false`) even against the current **in-repo** v2-ready engine — see
[baseline-v2.json](../../../../scripts/evaluation/email/baseline-v2.json). It currently returns
`receiving_work`/`existing_provider_instruction` instead: recognising it as *work* correctly, but not yet
as an update on an *existing* case, because that needs the ref-gate/context policy (open-case ref match),
not text signals alone — and the ref-gate's acting path is gated off (`TRIAGE_REF_GATE_ENABLED`) pending
D7. Not yet deployed live either way. The scope-to-confirm question in the Problem section above is still
open — not resolved by this pass.

## Scope resolved + Acceptance — 2026-07-08 (operator-confirmed scope (a); gates now live)

**Scope confirmed (ticket-orchestrate batch, 2026-07-08):** this ticket is **(a) the
images-on-an-existing-case routing failure** — the residue TKT-034 was narrowed to on 2026-07-07. It is
**not** the thread-scope chaser arm (that stays TKT-030). The gate state has also moved on since the
2026-07-02 note above: per [ticket board](../../BOARD.md) §D7, the taxonomy DDL is **applied live** and the
`TRIAGE_*` gates (`TRIAGE_IMAGES_ROUTING_ENABLED`, `TRIAGE_REF_GATE_ENABLED`) are `true` on
`cespk-orch-dev` (verify against the [registry](../../../operations/live-environment.md) /
`LIVE_FACTS.json`). So the ref-gate acting path is **available** — the remaining work is the follow-up
fix pass, not a gate flip.

### Acceptance

- [ ] The sample (`RE Ref160404_GN14GBE_… Chaser for engineers report.eml`, eval id
  `tkt043-images-existing-case`, `provider_match_state: one`) routes as **`case_update` /
  `images_received`** when its ref (`Ref 160404`) matches an **open** case — driven by the
  ref-gate / context policy (open-case ref match + new image evidence → `case_update`, the plan's
  Phase-2 precedence rule), **not** base text signals alone (which correctly see *work* but can't tell
  the ref is an existing case). Proven offline: the eval item flips from its current
  `receiving_work`/`existing_provider_instruction` miss to a hit (`category_correct: true`) under a
  genuine open-case-ref context signal (mirroring the `provider_match_state` context convention — **not**
  a hard-coded per-sample pass), and/or a deterministic `@cs/domain` triage-policy test asserts the relabel.
- [ ] Side effect is **suggest-first attach to the existing case** — reuse the shipped `attach_case` /
  `ai_suggestion` → reversible `inbound_linked` machinery (TKT-093); the images PDF attaches as evidence
  + archives on the matched case. **No new case is minted** (belt-and-braces: `case_update` is a
  non-minting category).
- [ ] **No regression:** the full eval corpus stays green (`baseline-v2` regenerated + `--check` clean;
  `receiving_work` recall holds ≈94%); `@cs/domain` + parser-classifier suites pass; `node verify-all.mjs`
  stays green.
- [ ] Deployed live to `cespk-orch-dev` under the **existing** `TRIAGE_REF_GATE_ENABLED` /
  `TRIAGE_IMAGES_ROUTING_ENABLED` gates (no new gate). Live proof (verify-stage): a real open-case-ref
  chaser lands `case_update`/`images_received` + a reversible link suggestion (queryable in
  `ai_suggestion` / `audit_event`).
- [ ] `changes.md` drafted per the ticket-implement template; the `.eml` sample already lives in the
  ticket folder + eval corpus — record any new fixture/telemetry under `evidence/`.
