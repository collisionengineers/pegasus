# Verification — TKT-011: Case page de-jargon + layout fixes

## Verdict
TESTED (offline)

## Evidence
Full plain-language source sweep of the case-page components: no `engineer`-facing or file-format jargon strings (e.g. `Download JSON`, `Document AI` provenance labels) remain in the user-facing copy. Audit-level confirmation against the app charter's plain-language rule.

## Pending / gaps
Not re-screenshotted against the live deployed SPA in this pass — the sweep was over source. A live visual spot-check on `cespk-spa-dev` would close the loop. Live SPA state: see ../../operations/live-environment.md.

## How to re-verify
- Grep the case-page components under `apps/web/` for banned strings (`JSON`, `Document AI`, file-format/provenance labels).
- Load the case page on the deployed SPA and eyeball the layout + field badges.
