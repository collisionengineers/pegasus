# Complete vehicle enrichment and warn when a registration cannot be resolved

## Problem
Cases can remain without mileage, make, or model even when a valid registration is present and the live DVLA/DVSA enrichment path should supply those details. When the registration is not found or a lookup fails, the case does not give staff a durable, understandable warning.

## Evidence
- [Operator note](./evidence/operator-note.md) — missing mileage/make/model and warning requirement.
- TKT-044 — arithmetic verification only; it does not cover field completeness or failure visibility.
- TKT-147 — a Tractable-specific make/VIN extraction path, not general enrichment.

## Proposed change
PROPOSED (not built): census the live gaps, make the canonical enrichment outcome explicit, repair persistence and precedence, surface plain-language warnings, and backfill eligible cases safely.

## Acceptance
- A live census identifies every active case with a registration but missing make, model, or mileage, grouped by provider, intake path, lookup outcome, and last enrichment attempt.
- For a canonical valid registration, one enrichment request returns a typed outcome for vehicle identity/details and MOT-based mileage: found, not found, insufficient MOT evidence, invalid registration, temporarily unavailable, or configuration/auth failure.
- One authenticated Data API route owns this request and is wired to orchestration, Manual Intake and an explicit case retry; the UI never falls back to the current `not_connected` placeholder transport.
- Document-extracted values remain authoritative when valid; enrichment fills only absent/invalid fields and never silently replaces a staff-confirmed value.
- A successful lookup persists make and model consistently across initial intake, manual image-only creation followed by instructions, merge/adoption, and explicit retry.
- Automatic enrichment or the working retry covers every case with a valid registration and unresolved model/mileage; no provider path is skipped on the assumption that a nonexistent staff trigger will run later.
- Mileage uses the canonical estimator in TKT-152 and stores enough source/method metadata to distinguish an observed reading from an estimate.
- `not found`, `invalid registration`, `insufficient evidence`, and transient/service failure remain distinct. Staff see a durable plain-language case warning with a retry path where retry is meaningful.
- Required vehicle fields that remain unresolved keep the case Not Ready. A transient warning is not silently cleared until a later successful result is persisted.
- Retry and orchestration logic is idempotent and bounded; it does not create duplicate audits or overwrite later human edits.
- A backup-first remediation retries all eligible missing-field cases and produces a before/after/residual ledger without touching cases that lack a defensible registration.
- Tests cover GB/NI registration normalisation, lookup success, not-found, insufficient MOT history, timeouts/retries, document precedence, staff precedence, merge, and repeated delivery.
- Live proof includes successful enrichment, a naturally occurring operator-designated not-found result with visible warning, and a final census that accounts for every remaining gap; unavailable live outcome classes remain PENDING rather than being manufactured.
- Case A.QDOS26088 is a pinned regression: the supplied instruction/registration reaches the real vehicle
  lookup path, the warning identifies its actual outcome, and “Check again” starts a fresh bounded attempt
  with visible progress and a terminal result rather than doing nothing.
- The retry action is available only for retryable outcomes. Invalid/not-found results explain the next
  handler action; authentication/configuration failures are observable to support staff and never
  misrepresented as an unknown registration.

## Validation

- A.QDOS26088 and the supplied AY15EWU source document/email are fixture-linked through registration
  normalisation, route request, outcome mapping, persistence and UI state; a test fails if the button has no
  request side effect.
- Fake-clock tests cover retry backoff, double-click, stale response, timeout, eventual success and permanent
  failure while preserving a later staff edit.
- Signed-in live verification records the initial warning, network call triggered by Check again, terminal
  outcome, resulting fields/warning and audit/telemetry correlation for the same case.
