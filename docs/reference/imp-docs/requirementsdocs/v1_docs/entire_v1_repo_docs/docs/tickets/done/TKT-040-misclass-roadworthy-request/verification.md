# Verification — TKT-040: Informal roadworthy work-request misrouted to 'Other'

## Verdict
VERIFIED-LIVE (2026-07-02) — live-probed against the deployed engine; locked by an eval-corpus regression pin

## Evidence
- Live probe: the deployed `/classify-email` route (`cespike-parser-dev`) classifies `(EREF5) RTA on
  27_06_2026  Mr Mohammed Osman Ahmed (Our Ref HMA_46428_1, Vehicle WN14XPZ).eml` as
  `receiving_work`/`existing_provider_instruction` (a work request, not 'Other') — per the rules-engine-v2
  plan's own evidence base, [rules_engine_v2_plan_9ba034c4.plan.md § Evidence base](TKT-040-misclass-roadworthy-request.md).
- Regression pin: manifest item `tkt040-roadworthy-informal` in the committed real-email eval harness —
  `category_correct`/`subtype_correct` both `true` at confidence `0.8` in the checked-in
  [baseline-v2.json](../../../../scripts/evaluation/email/baseline-v2.json) (v2-taxonomy aggregate 84.1%, up from
  the v1 baseline 77.3% — [README](../../../../scripts/evaluation/email/README.md)).

## Pending / gaps
Flagged **verified-by-eval but fragile until Phase 2** by the plan's own evidence base: today's correct
result comes from the existing text-signal rules, not yet from a context-aware policy — see
[docs/tickets/BOARD.md](../../BOARD.md) §D6/D7 for the `TRIAGE_*` gates that harden it (currently OFF). No fresh
real-world re-occurrence has been observed since — the probe replayed the original evidence file.

## How to re-verify
`python scripts/evaluation/email/run_eval.py --check scripts/evaluation/email/baseline-v2.json`
(regression gate), or re-POST `evidence/(EREF5) RTA on 27_06_2026  Mr Mohammed Osman Ahmed (Our Ref
HMA_46428_1, Vehicle WN14XPZ).eml` to the deployed `/classify-email` route directly.
