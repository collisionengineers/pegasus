# Fix multi-format document extraction regression

## Problem
Extraction is only reliably returning the registration; the rest of the 12-field EVA payload is coming
back sparse. Parsing must work across **PDF, .doc, .docx, .eml and .msg**. Need to find the source of
the regression.

## Evidence
The parser engine is the vendored `cedocumentmapper_v2.0` core in the retained parser Function
(`cespike-parser-dev`, `POST /api/parse`). Authoring source of truth is the sibling repo (edit-in-sibling,
re-vendor — ADR-0018). See the research pack for the suspected drift points and the format coverage gaps.

## Proposed change
Diff the vendored engine vs the sibling, identify what regressed the multi-field extraction, restore
full-field coverage across all five formats, and re-vendor + redeploy the parser Function.

## Acceptance
A representative instruction in each of PDF / DOC / DOCX / EML / MSG returns the populated EVA fields
(not just the registration), with field-level provenance, verified by re-intake.

## Research
- Operator stub: [document-parsing.md](TKT-001-document-parsing.md)
- Research pack: [research/document-parsing.md](TKT-001-document-parsing.md)
- Sample instruction fixtures live under [pdf-image-extraction/](TKT-001-document-parsing.md).
