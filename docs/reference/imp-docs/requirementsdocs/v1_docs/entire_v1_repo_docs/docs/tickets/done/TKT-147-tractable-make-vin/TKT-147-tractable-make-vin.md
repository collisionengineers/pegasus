# TKT-147 — Tractable layout: capture vehicle make (two-label rule) + a VIN field slot

## Problem

The Tractable layout extracts model but not make (needs a two-label rule kind in the engine), and the engine has no VIN field slot at all.

## Evidence

- [evidence/operator-note.md](./evidence/operator-note.md) — final-wave workflow finding, 2026-07-09.

## Proposed change

PROPOSED (not built): sibling-first — add a two-label capture rule kind + a VIN envelope field; fixtures on the Tractable samples.

## Acceptance

- Tractable samples extract make + model (+ VIN where present) with fixtures.
- No regression in the sibling suite.

## Research

Filed 2026-07-09 from the final-wave D2 report (PLAN-003 workflow finding).
