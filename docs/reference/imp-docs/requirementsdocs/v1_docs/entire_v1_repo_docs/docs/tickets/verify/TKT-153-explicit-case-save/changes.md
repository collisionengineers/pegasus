# Changes — TKT-153: Save case edits explicitly as one reviewed change

## Status
Implemented on `codex/tkt-153-explicit-save`; awaiting PR review, deployment and live verification.

## Changes
- Case EVA fields and the inspection choice now form one local edit session. Blur,
  dropdown, calendar and address-choice interactions do not write to the server.
- Added Save changes and Discard changes controls, complete field validation,
  unsaved-change status, browser/route leave protection and an optimistic-concurrency
  reload/reconcile path.
- Replaced the competing inspection-address PATCH plus decision POST with one
  versioned PATCH. The API writes fields, address, decision, readiness, manual
  provenance and one redacted audit entry in one transaction.
- The readiness calculation now receives the saved inspection decision in that
  transaction, uses the Case/PO being saved (including a value entered by that same
  request, or a real empty value when cleared) as an identity on the same terms as the
  canonical evaluator; the audit-only “cleared” label never enters readiness,
  and isolated registration, Case/PO and accepted-suggestion updates advance the
  edit-session baseline/version together so they cannot create a false dirty state,
  stale-save conflict or erroneous exception status.
- Photo review remains an immediately saved operation and is labelled as such on the
  Evidence tab; registration and Case/PO retain their existing explicit, isolated
  Save/Cancel controls.
- Manual saves update only the newest staff provenance row and retain extracted,
  conflicting and prior source rows. Readiness now selects current-value provenance
  deterministically (reviewed, then staff, then newest) with harmless earlier formatting
  normalisation; unrelated old values cannot make a field appear reviewed.
- Confirmed inspection-address corpus rows are case-disambiguated, so two cases using the
  same address cannot overwrite each other's source note.

## Read-only live continuity check

The active database was checked before merge. Across all populated EVA fields, there were
zero reviewed provenance rows whose value failed the tolerant current-value comparison and
zero reviewed null-value rows. The stricter deterministic resolver therefore does not
downgrade any currently reviewed live field. The temporary caller-IP database rule was
removed after the read-only query.
