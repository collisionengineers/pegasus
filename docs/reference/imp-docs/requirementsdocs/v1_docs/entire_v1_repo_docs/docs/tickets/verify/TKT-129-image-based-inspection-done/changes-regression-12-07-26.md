# Regression changes — TKT-129 — 2026-07-12

## Status
implemented and tested offline; deployment and fresh Chrome proof pending

The earlier server-owned provider default remains. The Address tab now presents one controlled choice between an inspection address and Image Based Assessment.

## What changed

- Removed the paragraph beginning `This provider works from photos` from the rendered source and production build.
- Replaced the scattered suggestion list plus override checkbox/button with one labelled radio choice.
- Selecting Image Based Assessment hides search, suggested addresses and address-only actions. Selecting Inspection address reveals them again.
- A new Image Based Assessment choice joins its required reason to the existing explicit Save changes transaction; it performs no isolated write.
- An existing saved Image Based Assessment choice remains visible without inventing a new edit or demanding a replacement prior reason.
- Returning to that saved choice after briefly selecting Inspection address is a true no-op: no reason, save request or navigation warning is created.
- Switching away from an unsaved physical-address choice and back restores that draft and its source note.
- Switching a saved image-based case to Inspection address clears the stale image-based draft and keeps Save blocked until an address is selected.
- Ordinary unknown/manual cases remain address-first. The UI reflects saved image-based truth but does not infer it from an empty address.
- The choice row wraps at narrow widths rather than forcing horizontal overflow.
- The suggested-locations heading is hidden when there are no suggestions or suggestion action to show; address search remains available.

## Offline evidence

- `npm run test --workspace @cs/web -- --run src/shared/ui/InspectionChoice.test.tsx src/features/cases/case-edit-session.test.ts` — 16/16 passed.
- `npm run test --workspace @cs/web` — 48 files / 515 tests passed after the review corrections.
- `npm run build --workspace @cs/web` — passed.
- Source and built-asset scan found zero copies of the removed paragraph and old override labels.

## Pending live proof

- Deploy the reviewed SPA head.
- In Chrome, verify one configured image-based provider and one ordinary provider at desktop and narrow width, including choice switching, hidden controls, Save/Cancel and reload.
