# PLAN-001 — Harden and extend AI and agent capabilities

## Outcome

Deliver useful assistant, search, image-analysis and agent-facing capabilities without weakening staff
authorization, data boundaries or human confirmation for writes.

## Decisions

- The Data API enforces authorization for every capability.
- Read tools use the narrowest data access required for their answer.
- Model output proposes work; it never bypasses staff confirmation or server-side validation.
- Agent-facing writes remain out of scope until identity, capability authorization, concurrency and
  audit requirements are separately accepted.
- Image processing remains separated from case-field updates so each result can be reviewed and traced.
- Feature availability is controlled explicitly and defaults to unavailable until approved.

## Sequence

1. Stabilize current assistant lookups, observability and shared domain normalization.
2. Complete the staff assistant interaction and search work.
3. Verify the human-confirmed write tier and read-only agent interface.
4. Finish the image-analysis family only after model, capacity, privacy and review requirements pass.

## Close-out

Every member ticket must have its own acceptance evidence. The plan closes only when all members are
`done` or have been explicitly transferred to another active plan.
