# Intermediate intake status beyond 'new'

## Problem
Everything currently shows a single "new" status. There is no way to distinguish
a case that has merely arrived from one that has been **added to / acknowledged
by the intake system** (triaged). Staff need an intermediate status so the board
reflects that a case has progressed past raw arrival, instead of everything
sitting at "new".

## Evidence
- `evidence/operator-note.md` — the operator's drop-note asking for a status for
  a case that's been added to the intake system instead of "new" for everything.
- `evidence/1.png` — screenshot showing cases all at "new".

## Proposed change
PROPOSED (not built):
- Add an intermediate intake status between raw arrival and review (e.g. an
  "added to intake" / "triaged" state) within the documented status machine
  (`new_email → ingested → needs_review → ready_for_eva → eva_submitted`),
  rather than overloading "new".
- Have the case transition into that status automatically once it has been
  ingested into the intake system, and surface it on the board/queues.

## Acceptance
- A case that has been added to the intake system shows a distinct status from a
  just-arrived "new" case.
- The new status is set automatically as part of ingestion (no manual step).
- The board/queues reflect the new status so staff can see progress at a glance.
