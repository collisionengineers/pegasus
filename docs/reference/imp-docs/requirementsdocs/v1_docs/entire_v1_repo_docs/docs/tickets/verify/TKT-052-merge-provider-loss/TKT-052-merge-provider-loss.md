# Merged image-only case loses the provider (merge logic wrong)

> **Sweep PENDING 2026-07-10** — fix deployed + offline-proven (22/22), but **no live route merge
> has ever executed** (0 `mergeCases` POSTs in 90d) and the SPA dialog's same-provider candidate
> filter makes the fill branch UI-unreachable for the exact operator scenario; see
> [verification.md](./verification.md) (follow-up candidate: relax the dialog filter to ADR-0010).

## Problem (operator drop-note, verbatim in [evidence/operator-note.md](./evidence/operator-note.md))

Merge thinking is wrong for cases that are merged together: the image-only side has no provider,
and the main (instructions) case's provider is potentially unknown — so the merged result can end up
with **no provider** when one half actually knew it.

## Notes

Split out of the old `TKT-041-merge-fix` folder on 2026-07-02 (TKT-041 now covers cancellation
only). Screenshot evidence: [`1.png`](./evidence-manifest.json). This is TKT-028 territory (provider population at
resolve/merge) — the merge must prefer whichever side carries a resolved provider, with provenance.

## Delivery

Rides the Phase-3 identification work of the
[Rules Engine v2 plan](TKT-052-merge-provider-loss.md) (provider resolution at
caseResolve), with the merge-preference fix verified against the ADR-0010 dedup ladder.

## Artifacts

- [changes.md](./changes.md) — merge-provider inheritance build record (2026-07-09 intake wave).
