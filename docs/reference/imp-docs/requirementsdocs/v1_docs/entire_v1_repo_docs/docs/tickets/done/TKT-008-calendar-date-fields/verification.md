# Verification — TKT-008: Calendar picker on the date-of-incident / instruction fields

## Verdict
TESTED (offline)

## Evidence
`apps/web/src/shared/ui/date-format.test.ts` passes 12/12. The DateField date-picker is bound and
rendered on both date fields, and the SPA build is PASS (confirmed by audit of the `94902ce` change set).

## Pending / gaps
None known. A live click-through in the deployed SPA would confirm the picker renders end-to-end.

## How to re-verify
Run `npm run test --workspace @cs/web` and confirm `date-format.test.ts` is green (12/12).
