# Make the inbox actionable (dismiss removes from view)

## Problem
The inbox is basically a read-only display. It needs **real actions** a handler can take — and in
particular, **dismissing an email currently does not remove it from the view**.

## Evidence
Inbound mail is one row per arrival in `inbound_email` with a `triage_state`; the user-facing triage API
can set `triage_state` but handled mail still shows in active views. Dismiss/handle state must persist so
it leaves the active list (see the research pack for the route + persistence gap).

## Proposed change
Persist a dismiss/handled/action state on the inbound-email row and filter the active inbox views by it,
so a dismissed or actioned email leaves the working list.

## Acceptance
Dismissing an email removes it from the active inbox view and the state survives a reload; the action is
auditable.
