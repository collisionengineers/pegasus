# PCH not identified — doc-content name + @pch-ltd.com senders both missed

> **VERIFIED-LIVE 2026-07-10** — both arms proven live at volume (54 PCH-resolved cases since the
> 2026-07-02 deploy: 53 sender-domain + 1 doc-content, plus 84 content-arm firings across 10+
> providers and 4 never-override disagreement audits); see [verification.md](./verification.md).
> The 2026-07-02 "D8 not yet applied" note below is prior — D8 was applied 2026-07-03.

The implementation record is in [changes.md](./changes.md); the live proof is in
[verification.md](./verification.md).

## Problem (operator drop-note, verbatim in [evidence/operator-note.md](./evidence/operator-note.md))

Intake fails to identify PCH (**Performance Car Hire** — the name is present in the body of the
inspection-request document), and direct mails from `*@pch-ltd.com` senders aren't categorised as
PCH either.

## Wanted

Two fixes working together (ADR-0011): the parser's doc-content provider detection must map to a
real `work_provider_id` at case-resolve (doc content is the *primary* provider signal), and
`@pch-ltd.com` joins the provider's own match domains — while intermediary-routed traffic (Connexus,
TKT-021) resolves through the Image-Source intermediary map.

## Evidence

- `Enclosing Inspection Request to Engineers 2 (Collision Engineers Ltd)  577349.eml`
- `Inspection Request - Audit Report.DOC`
- `_EHR102814_Engineers Repair Images_08076836.pdf`, `_EHR102814_Plus_.pdf`, `_EHR102814_Plus_Report_.pdf`

## Delivery

Phase 3 of the [Rules Engine v2 plan](TKT-051-pch-connexus.md)
(identification upgrade).

## Status update — 2026-07-03 (the "EVA (Engineers)" mislabel root-caused → TKT-056)

The operator reported these same PCH audit emails surfacing with work provider **"EVA (Engineers)"**.
Root cause chain (verified): the parse activity picked ONE attachment and preferred PDF → on an audit
email it parsed the attached third-party **EVA report** instead of the `.DOC` instruction; the engine's
layout-name fallback then emitted `"EVA (Engineers)"` as `work_provider`, which filled the case's
free-text `eva_work_provider`. Fixed in code (engine-v2.6 fallback guard + multi-doc content-typed
parse pick + a Data-API denylist) plus an operator delta deactivating any stale EVA corpus row —
all under **[TKT-056](../TKT-056-audit-case-type-activation/TKT-056-audit-case-type-activation.md)**
/ [ADR-0021](../../../adr/0021-case-po-marker-taxonomy.md) / [ticket board §D9](../../BOARD.md).

## Status update — 2026-07-02 (now — code deployed, activation pending D8 seeds)

`3a772d1` (feat(identification): Image-Source intermediary resolution + parser-string →
work_provider_id mapping, ADR-0011) deployed live on `cespk-api-dev`/`cespk-orch-dev`. Verified-first
against this ticket's own evidence: the doc-content provider detector already extracts "PCH" from
`Inspection Request - Audit Report.DOC` at confidence **1.0** — the gap was that the detected string was
never mapped to a real `work_provider_id`; that mapping is now live at `caseResolve` (fill-if-empty +
provenance). The `@pch-ltd.com` domain addition to PCH's `known_email_domains` rides the operator-gated
seed delta [`2026-07-02-rules-engine-v2-identification.sql`](../../../../database/migrations/2026-07-02-rules-engine-v2-identification.sql)
([docs/tickets/BOARD.md](../../BOARD.md) §D8), **not yet applied live**. No live re-probe of this exact sample has
been run post-deploy — awaiting the D8 apply to exercise both signals together.
