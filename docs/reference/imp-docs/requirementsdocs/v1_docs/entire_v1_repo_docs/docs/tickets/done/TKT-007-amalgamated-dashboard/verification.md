# Verification — TKT-007: Combine email + intake overviews into one compact dashboard

## Verdict
TESTED (offline)

## Evidence
`services/data-api/src/features/cases/dashboard-routes.test.ts` passes 10/10. The dashboard endpoint, data hooks, and the
amalgamated UI are wired (confirmed by audit of the `94902ce` change set). Live intake/count state is in
the registry [live-environment.md](../../../operations/live-environment.md).

## Pending / gaps
None known. A live click-through in the deployed SPA would add end-to-end confidence beyond the offline
unit tests.

## How to re-verify
Run `npm run test --workspace api` and confirm `dashboard.test.ts` is green (10/10).
