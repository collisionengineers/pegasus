# Evidence — preliminary offline gate battery (historical snapshot)

This file records the Stage-2 run on branch tip `ba675336`. It is retained as preliminary-review evidence,
not as evidence for the reconciled release commit. Reproduced in an isolated worktree after `npm ci`, every offline gate the
reset ships **passed**. This is the objective floor; the lane reviews audit whether each gate is *meaningful*.

The current Stage-3 disposition and release gates are in [`../final-review.md`](../final-review.md).

## Stage-3 final local result

The reconciled staged tree at `bbe20b3e` completed `node verify-all.mjs` with **34 passed, 0 failed** after a clean
dependency install. That run's gate counts were 3,085 tracked paths, 189 routes, 56 DTO declarations,
7 JSON schemas, 64 Postgres tables, 22 numeric code tables, 881 owned source files, 1,121 Markdown files,
211 tickets, 6 plans, 3,268 baseline files and 3,083 non-recursive final files with zero unexplained.
The forbidden-reference check scanned 2,467 tracked files with no match. Component results and the release
decision are recorded in the final review. The subsequent Linux-package regression guard and TKT-165
corrective migration add two tracked files; focused replacement checks cover 3,087 paths, 2,469 policy-
scanned files and 40 repository-check tests while replacement GitHub CI remains the release authority.

| `check:line-endings` (normalize-line-endings.mjs --check) | PASS | — | hygiene |

## Build / test gates
- `npm ci` — completed clean (exit 0).
- `node verify-all.mjs` — **34 passed, 0 failed.** TS builds + tests for @cs/domain, @cs/api, @cs/orchestration,
  @cs/web; all 6 Python suites (archive-webhook, eva-sentry, location-assist, ocr, parser, vehicle-enrichment)
  + the email-evaluation tests ran and PASSED; all structural/doc/reconciliation checks PASSED.

## The load-bearing caveat
Every gate above is computed on the **post-reset tree** and several are **self-referential** — they cannot
detect that the branch is 57 commits behind main and is missing #73/#83/#87/#89's tables/features (see
`spa-database/review.md`, `reconciliation/review.md`, `runtime-surface/review.md`). **Green ≠ complete.** The
`capture_session` / `archive_holding` / `evidence_deletion` / `mcp_http_session` tables were confirmed ABSENT at
merge-base `81ae8fdf` and present on `origin/main` — i.e. added after the base, and reverted by this branch.

Stage 3 resolved this caveat by merging current main, reconciling every later feature against the new layout,
and strengthening the reconciliation from labels to byte-checked dispositions anchored to the immutable
pre-reset main commit. The final release run is recorded in the final review rather than overwriting these
historical numbers.

## Notes for the lane audits
- `check:forbidden` printing *"No configured signatures found"* is the one gate output that reads as possibly
  vacuous — Lane H runs it down (`forbidden-signatures.json` populated vs empty).
- `check:runtime-contract` passing proves internal consistency of the current tree; Lane D determines whether
  it also diffs the **frozen** `70a3bb57` baseline (true invariance) or only regenerates from HEAD.
- `check:reconciliation` "0 unexplained" is path-level bookkeeping; Lane A determines whether "explained" also
  requires **content/hash preservation** or only accounts for path disposition.
