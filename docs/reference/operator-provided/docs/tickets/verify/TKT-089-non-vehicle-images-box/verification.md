# Verification — TKT-089: Confirm non-vehicle images (signatures/logos) are no longer stored on Box

## Verdict
VERIFIED-LIVE

Verified by: fresh ticket-verifier dispatch, 10-07-26, after the same-day reopen fix. Transcribed
findings:

- **Line 3 (the re-fixed line) — the verifier's OWN independent re-probe PASSES:** both named
  samples POSTed to the live /extract-images → HTTP 200, **count = 1 each** (only the ~29KB MGAA
  badge jpeg); the 10,720B QDOS-logo png that failed the morning verdict is GONE (engine-v2.15
  3.2-aspect retune live: 575×174 = 3.305 ≥ 3.2).
- **Mirror filter observed live in independent telemetry:** the 17:49:34–45Z archive run on
  A.QDOS26009 — box-archive-start 202 → archive-evidence GET 200 → summary
  `{uploaded:1, total:1}` where the case held TWO unmirrored blob rows: the excluded logo was not
  offered, the legit 19.1MB .eml mirrored. Pre-fix total would have been 2. Filter + recall in one
  run.
- **Bundles + ordering verified:** .artifacts/deploy/data-api/main.cjs:18396 `AND excluded = false` in the
  archive-evidence selection; .artifacts/deploy/orchestration/main.cjs 49988–52400 (role other + nonVehicleExcluded →
  excluded + auto-classified reason; extractImages passes the flag; excludedNonVehicle on the
  summary event); all three orchestrator lanes sequence classifyPersist → extractImages →
  boxArchiveEvidence (intakeOrchestrator.ts:134→141→156 / 283→291→307 / 694→708→728); both persist
  lanes stamp excluded in-memory BEFORE persist; person-reflection precedence + classify-null
  fail-open confirmed.
- **Fixtures + provenance:** vendored test_extract_images 18/18; drift guard 7/7 (vendored
  byte-identical to sibling); sibling tag engine-v2.15 = 79efe22 pushed (ls-remote verified); the
  204×204 badge deliberately classifier-owned (documented in-code) — and its live classification is
  not speculative: the 07-09 audit found the badge class already classified `other` across ~40
  cases.
- **Lines 1/2/4 held** from the prior verdicts (audit + cleanup 163/163 residual-0; email lane
  0 name-suspects across 1,160 forward rows + the 3.2 lockstep retune in the deployed orch bundle;
  backfill decision executed per ADR-0012/0017).
- **Post-deploy health:** 0 failed / 0 exceptions on all four apps since 17:20Z.
- **Documented residual (deliberate design):** classify-failure fail-open — a persistent AOAI
  outage could leak badge-class crops to Box (chosen to protect archive recall; the
  engine-suppressed logo class cannot leak regardless).
- **Queued confirmatory SQL (QA–QD, next data pass):** forward-window suspect crops
  unexcluded-and-mirrored (expect 0); badge class landing excluded-not-mirrored; recall counts;
  the A.QDOS26009 lever spot-check rows. Watch: the next natural letterhead intake should show
  excludedNonVehicle ≥ 1 on its extractImages event.

**For the fresh verifier:**
1. Re-run the two-sample `/extract-images` probe (scratchpad `tkt089-reprobe.py` pattern; parser
   function key via `az functionapp keys list`) — expect count = 1 per sample, only the ~29 KB badge
   jpeg (the 10.7 KB logo png gone).
2. The badge's excluded-and-not-mirrored path: on the next post-17:35Z QDOS letter intake, the case
   should show NO `img_1_1` logo evidence row, the badge row `excluded=true` with reason
   `non-vehicle image detected (auto-classified)` and `box_file_id NULL`, and the orch
   `extractImages` App Insights event carrying `excludedNonVehicle >= 1`
   (`traces | where message contains '"evt":"extractImages"' | where timestamp > datetime(2026-07-10T17:35:00Z)`).
3. Forward-window SQL (the recon query in changes.md): suspect-class rows created AFTER
   2026-07-10T17:35Z should be zero-or-excluded, never `excluded=false AND in_box=true`.
4. Mirror filter regression-free: a genuine post-deploy intake still mirrors its photos/docs
   (boxArchiveEvidence `uploaded > 0`; W2 Q5 recall baseline 744 kept / 671 mirrored for reference).

## Prior verdict (2026-07-10, superseded by the deployed reopen fix above)
FAILED (live, acceptance line 3) — reopened to `now` 2026-07-10 with a dated follow-up
([evidence/reopen-followup-100726.md](./evidence/reopen-followup-100726.md)).

Verified by: ticket-verifier dispatch, 10-07-26. Lines 1, 2 and 4 individually PASS; line 3 (the
PDF-lane sample re-parse) FAILS a direct live probe:

- **The decisive probe:** compute-only POST of two real retained `LtrtoEngineerIn.pdf` samples to the
  live /extract-images (engine-v2.13) → HTTP 200, **count=2 both times — the QDOS Assistance logo
  (575×174, 10,720 B) and the MGAA badge (204×204, ~29 KB) still extract**, visually identical to
  the ticket's own screenshot and byte-matched to the audit's ~40-case recurring-suspect class. Both
  evade the deployed heuristics by tiny margins (aspect 3.305 < 3.5; area 41,616 vs the 40,000 floor,
  +4% and square so the banner rung can't apply). Fixtures pass only because they test shapes the
  thresholds catch (900×180, 80×40). Recall half is fine (synthetic 1600×1200 photo kept; W2 Q5:
  744 kept / 671 mirrored).
- **Compounding storage gap:** extractImages persists every parser-returned image, and the Box mirror
  selection (internal.ts:2727-2736) has NO excluded/role filter — classifier-stamped non-vehicle
  crops still mirror into the Box case folder. The classifier lanes mitigate the evidence view + EVA
  flow, not Box storage.
- **What passed:** line 1 — the written audit + lane split (881 email / 4,129 PDF rows; 165 suspects)
  and the executed cleanup (163/163, 107 audits, residual 0, live-checked 07-09); line 2 — the email
  lane forward window (0 name-suspects in Box across 1,160 new rows; floor acting, 62 skips today);
  line 4 — the backfill decision recorded + executed (evidence-row-only; Box copies retained per
  ADR-0012/0017).
- **Queued SQL** (quantifies the forward-window PDF-lane leak; run at the next data pass): the
  forward-window extraction-crop query in the verifier block — expect QDOS-logo (~10.7KB png) /
  MGAA-badge (~29KB jpeg) rows present, most with in_box=true.
- **How to re-verify after the fix:** re-run the probe script
  (scratchpad tkt089-real-sample-probe.py pattern, function key via az functionapp keys list) on the
  two named samples — fixed state = count 0 or excluded-and-not-mirrored; then the queued SQL.

## Prior verdict (2026-07-09)
PARTIAL — the PDF-lane suppression BUILT + DEPLOYED (offline-proven); the live audit + backfill +
proof remained. Superseded by the FAILED probe above.

## Evidence (what is proven)
- **Offline test green:** `services/functions/parser/tests/test_extract_images.py:161`
  `test_small_decorative_image_is_filtered_out` — an 80×40 logo-sized raster yields `count == 0`
  ("must be filtered, not stored as evidence"); the docstring cites the exact QDOS26004 /
  `LtrtoEngineerIn__RJS_UnknownVRM_img_1_3` bug from this ticket's screenshot. Companion large-image
  test proves real photos are still kept.
- **Deployed on `main`:** the `is_decorative` floor (`service.py:401`, applied at lines 433 + 453) shipped
  via `aafeba1`; the parser Function serves it on `POST /extract-images`.

## Pending / gaps (required before `done`)
1. **Data audit** — Postgres + Box sweep of non-vehicle evidence images captured after `aafeba1`, split by
   lane (email-attachment vs PDF-extraction); queries + results recorded here.
2. **Email lane** — zero post-deploy signature captures (closes TKT-047's still-pending live proof), or fix.
3. **Live probe** — re-parse (or fresh intake) a letterhead-bearing PDF → no logo evidence rows and no logo
   files in the Box case folder.
4. **Recall guard** — a genuine vehicle-photo PDF still lands its images in evidence + Box.
5. **Backfill** — the delete/keep decision for existing non-vehicle images recorded + executed (audited).

## Coverage caveat
The fix is a 200×200 *area* floor, so a large logo/banner above that area is not caught. The audit must
confirm whether this residual actually manifests; if so, raise a follow-up (content/aspect heuristic), do
not silently treat this ticket as fully covering it.

## Verification pass — 08-07-26 (read-only)

Verified by: ticket-verifier dispatch, 08-07-26. Scope: the read-only subset (pending items 1–2);
items 3–5 need a non-read-only pass. Ticket stays in `verify`.

### Verdict
PENDING — no regression found on any readable surface; substantial live telemetry gathered for pending
items 1–2, but the decisive Postgres+Box data audit is unreachable read-only (the transient firewall
rule is a mutation; Box case-folder descent is outside the scope-guard allowlist).

### Evidence
- **Email lane (TKT-047 floor) live and acting:** no `GRAPH_IMAGE_FLOOR_DISABLED` on `cespk-orch-dev`;
  App Insights shows **221 signature-image skip traces** 2026-07-02T13:23Z → 2026-07-07T11:49Z (daily
  22/63/48/71/17; all dimension-sniff skips, 0 byte-floor fallbacks), e.g.
  `[graph] skipped attachment "image001.png" — likely signature/logo image (dimensions 140x78)`.
- **PDF lane serving the fixed engine:** parser `extract_images` requests since the 2026-07-04 `aafeba1`
  deploy: 3/3, 2/2, 67/67, 86/85, 4/4 ok by day.
- **Recall guard (read-only portion):** genuine vehicle photos still extract + persist post-floor —
  2026-07-06 cases `b4e379d1` (90 imgs, regVisible:true), `30eb86c5` (26), `4bfe252c` (42),
  `76e3fcdb` (47), `c1d1da42` (36), `cd9b6a97` (9), `4c80e215` (33). Box-mirror half not confirmable
  this pass.
- **Residual-gap signal:** post-deploy extractions named `RJS_UnknownVRM_img_1_*.jpeg` still occur —
  either genuine page-1 photos or banners above the 200×200 area floor; only the DB/bytes audit can
  disambiguate. The coverage caveat stays open, not disproven.

### Pending / gaps
Expected absences: the Postgres lane-split sweep + "zero post-deploy signature captures" DB proof
(workstation IP not in the `cespk-pg-dev` firewall; adding a rule is a mutation), Box case-folder
listings (allowlist is root-only). Real issue observed (out of scope, follow-up flagged): 382
`[extractImages] plate OCR failed … fetch failed` traces since 2026-07-04.

### How to re-verify
- Email-lane skips (app 7c7ea68a): `traces | where timestamp > datetime(2026-07-02T13:14:00Z) | where message contains "skipped attachment" | summarize total=count(), byteFloorSkips=countif(message contains "byte-size")`
- Parser serving (app da68d9aa): `requests | where timestamp > datetime(2026-07-04) | where name == "extract_images" | summarize n=count(), ok=countif(resultCode startswith "2") by bin(timestamp,1d)`
- Recall (app 7c7ea68a): `traces | where message contains '"evt":"extractImages"' | where timestamp > datetime(2026-07-04)`
- Postgres sweep (non-read-only pass; Entra admin → `SET ROLE csadmin`, transient FW rule): lane-split
  count of post-`2026-07-02T13:14Z` image evidence rows by
  `file_name ~ '_img_\d+_\d+'` (pdf lane) vs email attachment, flagging
  `file_name ~* '^image0\d\d|logo|signature|banner|^B64image'` and `size_bytes < 25000`; list any hits
  with case_id/file_name/box_file_id for the Box cross-check + backfill list.

## Verdict update — 2026-07-08

FAILED (live) — operator report 2026-07-08: signatures still being picked up and filed to Box from many emails. Email-lane floor provably acting (221 skip traces), so the leak points at above-floor signature images and/or the PDF-extraction lane. Reopened verify->now for the coverage fix.

Verified by: operator report transcribed by the orchestrating session, 2026-07-08.

## Audit record — 2026-07-09 (PLAN-003 lifecycle wave; verdict stays PENDING pending live probe)

- Lane-split + suspect queries and results: see changes.md §2026-07-09 (data captured via the
  csadmin window; transient FW rule added + removed).
- Cleanup verified live: `backup_20260709_tkt089_evidence` = 163 rows; excluded rows with
  exclusion_reason 'Non-vehicle image … TKT-089 …' = 163; per-case audit rows = 107; residual
  suspects (same heuristics) = **0**.
- Box cross-check basis: 133/163 excluded rows carried `box_file_id` (already mirrored) — the Box
  copies are deliberately left (ADR-0017; decision in changes.md).
- Still pending before `done`: live probe (letterhead PDF re-parse → no logo evidence; signature
  email → banner-shape skip) + recall guard (a genuine photo email/PDF still lands evidence+Box)
  on the engine-v2.11 / new-orch deploys.

## Regression verification — 2026-07-11

**Verdict: TESTED (offline) — deployment pending.**

This block supersedes every stale `done`, `VERIFIED-LIVE` or deployed verdict for the PR 55
regression repair. The earlier audit/backfill evidence remains prior evidence only.

- Parser engine `v2.16` and the email image-sniff path retain plausible panoramic vehicle photos.
  Automatic non-vehicle exclusion now requires high confidence and no readable registration signal;
  parser extraction and orchestration image-sniff regressions cover the recall guard.
- The evidence schema records decision ownership. Classifier retries may clear only a matching
  classifier-owned exclusion and restore acceptance; staff/provider/cleanup/earlier decisions remain
  protected. `internal-box-classification.test.ts`, `evidence.test.ts` and
  `evidence-review.test.ts` cover automatic recovery, durable staff edits and reload-safe review.
- The ownership delta safely interprets prior audit before/after snapshots and gives explicit
  staff decisions precedence. `database/tests/tkt089-staff-ownership-fixture.sql`
  covers staff, classifier, reflection-only and earlier exclusion-reason cases.
- Staff changes, accepted suggestions and classifier recovery request exact Archive-mirror and status
  generations. API/orchestration archive-mirror tests cover stale claims, retries, merge collisions,
  exact-row acknowledgement and a recovered photo becoming eligible for Archive/EVA again.
- Deployment proof still required: apply the additive schema, deploy parser/API/services/orchestration/SPA,
  rerun the ownership delta after the API cutover, then repeat the letterhead suppression and genuine
  panoramic-photo live probes. No new live result is claimed here.

## Verdict update — 2026-07-14 (independent PLAN-005 sweep; transcribed verbatim)

## Verdict

PENDING

## Evidence

- **A1 — Written lane audit:** prior live audit recorded 881 email-lane rows and 4,129 PDF-lane
  rows, identifying 165 suspect images. Cleanup excluded 163 rows, created 163 backup records and 107
  per-case audit entries, and left zero residual suspects.
- **A2 — Email-lane capture:** The July 10 forward window recorded 40 suspects, 38 already mirrored and
  zero excluded. This predates the July 11 regression repair, so it does not certify current behavior.
- **A3 — PDF reparse:** Two real `LtrtoEngineerIn.pdf` samples changed from two images to one: the QDOS
  575×174 logo was removed while the 204×204 MGAA badge remained classifier-owned. The repaired parser
  v2.16 was subsequently deployed on July 11.
- **A4 — Backfill:** The recorded decision was evidence-row-only remediation. It updated 163 rows without
  deleting retained Archive copies, consistent with the one-way-mirror rule.
- **R1 — Preserve plausible panoramas:** Current parser and orchestration source explicitly retain
  low-resolution panoramas for classification in
  `services/functions/parser/cedocumentmapper_v2/application/service.py:52` and
  `services/orchestration/src/platform/image-sniff.ts`. Parser v2.16 was deployed after the regression gates passed.
- **R2 — Conservative automatic exclusion:** Current classification paths carry registration-readability
  state and restrict automatic non-vehicle exclusion to classifier decisions. This is source/offline
  evidence only; no current natural input was observed.
- **R3 — Ownership durability:** Current API persistence records exclusion ownership/source in
  `services/data-api/src/features/`, preventing retries from treating staff, provider, cleanup or
  earlier decisions as classifier-owned.
- **R4 — Classifier-owned recovery:** Current API logic distinguishes classifiable and
  registration-bearing evidence in `services/data-api/src/features/`; recorded regression tests
  cover clearing only classifier-owned exclusions after later vehicle classification.
- **R5 — Staff review and reload:** The evidence-edit API persists role, registration, acceptance and
  exclusion ownership in `services/data-api/src/features/evidence/`. The deployment record reports the API
  and SPA repair deployed, but no signed-in live reload recovery was observed in this pass.
- **R6 — Retry protection:** Recorded regression tests cover preservation of staff/provider-owned
  inclusion and exclusion across classifier retries. This remains offline/deployment evidence.
- **R7 — Accepted vehicle suggestion:** Recorded regression tests cover making an accepted vehicle-role
  suggestion usable while clearing only classifier-owned exclusion. No current live staff interaction was
  observed.
- **R8 — Coverage and deployment:** The July 11 deployment record reports the TKT-089 fixture and
  aggregate gates passing before API, orchestration, parser and SPA publication; the ownership migration
  was replayed after API publication.

## Pending / gaps

- No natural post-deployment QDOS/banner or low-resolution panorama intake was observed against the
  current deployment.
- No fresh Postgres row trace, App Insights activity trace or read-only Archive listing was gathered for
  such an event.
- Staff-owned include/exclude durability, reload recovery and vehicle-suggestion acceptance were not
  exercised live.
- The deployed stack contains the TKT-089 repair lineage, but deployed source is not at current `main` SHA
  `308294c`; exact source/live parity therefore remains unproven.

## How to re-verify

1. Observe the next natural qualifying email or PDF intake without injecting a fixture.
2. Capture the extraction/classification trace and corresponding evidence rows, including ownership
   source, registration readability and exclusion reason.
3. Read the existing Archive folder to confirm suppressed artwork was not newly mirrored and retained
   vehicle evidence was mirrored; perform no writes or deletions.
4. For a staff-reviewed case, compare the persisted evidence decision before and after an ordinary retry
   and page reload.
5. Refresh the targeted offline regression suite from current `main` before certification.

## Confidence + unread surfaces

High confidence in the prior cleanup, current implementation and deployment lineage; medium
confidence in current live behavior. Unread surfaces are a fresh natural intake trace, current database
rows, current Archive contents and signed-in SPA persistence behavior.
