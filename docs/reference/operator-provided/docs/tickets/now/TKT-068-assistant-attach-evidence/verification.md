# Verification — TKT-068: Let the assistant understand images and add them to a case

Verified by: ticket-verifier dispatch, 08-07-26

## Verdict
PENDING — offline-provable classes all pass (SPA build + 312 tests green, confirm-before-write path,
TKT-060 invariant, plain-language rejection); live E2E classes deferred pending SPA/API deploy (BUILD-DARK
this pass). This matches the expected ceiling. It is **not** `TESTED (offline)` because Acceptance lines 3
and 4 explicitly require *live* proof (401/403 probe, blob landing, `evidence`+audit rows, Evidence-tab
render) — offline-only proof is not sufficient for this ticket.

## Evidence
*(one artifact per Acceptance line; commit `3f011fb` = SPA attach-UX slice, `754c38a` = prior server route)*

1. **Drawer accepts image/PDF, describes as context only** — OFFLINE-PROVEN.
   `AssistantDrawer.tsx:234-247` — hidden `<input type="file" accept="image/*,application/pdf" multiple>` +
   paperclip button. `send()` (L125-126) builds `note = attachmentNote(held.map(f => f.name))` and posts only
   `{role, content}` text to `assistantChat` (L133) — **bytes never sent to the model**. `attachmentNote`
   (`attach-validate.ts:89-91`) emits names/counts only. Removable chips L216-231. Build green.

2. **Confirmation card ALWAYS before any write; explicit confirm required** — OFFLINE-PROVEN.
   `AttachConfirmCard` renders whenever `attachments.length > 0 && showAttachCard`
   (`AssistantDrawer.tsx:207-213`; `showAttachCard` set true only after a turn carried attachments). The
   card's `confirm()` (`AttachConfirmCard.tsx:122-149`) is the **sole** caller of
   `getDataAccess().uploadEvidence(...)`, fired only from the primary "Add N files to {case}" button. No
   upload path exists outside that human click. Case resolved **independently** server-side via
   `openVrmTwins` (L100), not from the model's word.

3. **`POST /api/cases/{id}/evidence/upload` staff-gated, blob + rows** — PARTIAL: server code proven offline;
   **live behavior DEFERRED**. `evidence-upload.ts` wraps the route in `withRole('CollisionSpike.User')`
   (L28) → fail-closed 401/403; `classifyUpload` gate (L46); `uploadEvidenceBytes` → Blob (L54);
   `INSERT INTO evidence(...)` (L56-61); `writeAudit({action: AUDIT_ACTION.evidence_added, ...})` (L71-77).
   Route registered `services/data-api/src/index.ts:25`; `AUDIT_ACTION.evidence_added = 100000049` + code-table row present.
   All INSERT columns exist in `060_evidence.sql`. *Live 401/403 probe + actual blob landing + DB insert =
   deferred (needs deploy).*

4. **Files appear on Evidence tab + audit records actor** — DEFERRED (live render). Actor wiring present:
   `actorFromClaims(claims)` → `writeAudit(... actor)`. Rendered Evidence-tab preview (TKT-048 byte path)
   cannot be proven offline.

5. **Model has NO write tool — `TOOLS` SELECT-only (TKT-060 invariant)** — OFFLINE-PROVEN (load-bearing).
   `git show --stat 3f011fb -- services/data-api/` is **EMPTY** — the SPA slice touched zero Data API files.
   `toolsForRequest()` (`assistant.ts:137-148`) derives from `readCapabilities()` (SELECT-only); the only
   non-read addition is the pre-existing **dark-gated `propose_action`** (`assistantWriteTier()` off by
   default), which drafts a `ProposedAction` for human confirm and performs **no** DB write — and is **not**
   an upload/evidence tool. `execTool` switch is entirely SELECT. The model has no evidence-upload capability.

6. **Oversized/unsupported rejected in plain language** — OFFLINE-PROVEN.
   `attach-validate.ts:45-57`: `"That file is too big — the limit is 15 MB."` /
   `"That file looks empty, so I did not add it."` / `"I can only add photos and PDFs to a case."` Server
   mirror `services/data-api/src/features/evidence/upload-validate.ts` uses identical wording. `attach-validate.test.ts` asserts no
   banned tokens (mime/blob/payload/multipart/endpoint/byte/401/403). 19/19 green; full suite 312/312.

**Gates:** `npm --prefix apps/web run build` exit 0 · `npx vitest run` → 312 passed (21 files) ·
`attach-validate.test.ts` → 19 passed · `check-tickets` OK · `check-doc-links` OK.

## Pending / gaps
**Offline classes — PASSED:** Acceptance 1, 2, 5, 6 fully at code+build level; the server-route *code* for 3
(auth wrapper, blob, INSERT, audit) + its unit test; schema-continuity of the INSERT.

**Live classes — DEFERRED to post-deploy (expected — BUILD-DARK, not bugs):**
- Live attach→confirm→upload chain on the deployed SPA: (a) API response, (b) Postgres `evidence` row +
  `evidence_added` audit row for the case, (c) image renders on the Evidence tab (TKT-048 byte path).
- Negative live probe: direct `POST …/evidence/upload` no-token → 401; wrong-role → 403.
- Invariant audit re-confirmed against the *deployed* commit.

**Naming note (not a failure):** Acceptance/ticket says `case_evidence`; the live table is named **`evidence`**
(`060_evidence.sql`) and the route correctly targets it — terminology shorthand, not a code defect.

**Honesty flag:** a dark-gated `propose_action` tool exists in `toolsForRequest()` (TKT-111 write-tier, off
by default). It drafts proposals for human confirm, performs no write, and is not an upload tool — so the
TKT-060 evidence-upload invariant holds — but `TOOLS` is not *literally* SELECT-only when that gate flips.

## How to re-verify
- **Offline (repeatable now):** `npm --prefix apps/web run build`; `cd @cs/web && npx vitest run` (312)
  and `npx vitest run src/shared/ui/attach-validate.test.ts` (19); `npm --prefix services/data-api test`;
  `node scripts/checks/check-tickets.mjs`; `node scripts/checks/check-doc-links.mjs`; `git show --stat 3f011fb -- services/data-api/`
  (must be empty).
- **Live (after operator deploys SPA + API):** open the deployed SPA (`cespk-spa-dev`) assistant drawer →
  attach a real JPEG → name the case's registration → confirm the card. Then capture (a) the API response,
  (b) `SELECT file_name, kind_code, source_label FROM evidence WHERE case_id=…` and the `evidence_added` row
  in `audit_event`, (c) the image on the case Evidence tab. Then `POST …/api/cases/{id}/evidence/upload`
  with no `Authorization` header → expect 401; a `CollisionSpike`-unassigned token → expect 403.

## Confidence + unread surfaces
High confidence on the offline verdict — every offline-provable Acceptance line was read at source and
exercised (build + full test suite + isolated attach-validate run + both ticket gates). Could not read (by
design this pass): the deployed SPA and live API — the slice is BUILD-DARK, no deploy recorded. Live blob
landing, the Postgres row inserts, and the Evidence-tab render remain the only unproven surfaces, all gated
on the operator deploy.

## GO-LIVE — 2026-07-08 (deployed; one behavioral E2E class now captured)

Status: **LIVE-DEPLOYED**; the attach UX is live on the SPA. Behavioral upload E2E = one operator/SPA action
away (stays `verify`).

Executed (azure-integration-engineer dispatch): the SPA (`cespk-spa-dev`) was **deployed from `main a06d2dc`**
(200 + CSP; new bundle serving) and the Data API redeployed (86 functions incl. `uploadCaseEvidence` /
`evidenceContent`), so the attach UX is **live**. Progress against this ticket's 5-class Verification
requirements:
- **✅ Class 4 (negative live probe) — CAPTURED:** live `POST /api/cases/{id}/evidence/upload` **without a
  token → 401** (route deployed + fail-closed).
- **✅ Class 5 (invariant audit at the deployed commit):** `uploadCaseEvidence` is a staff route; the assistant
  `TOOLS` set carries no upload tool (`git show --stat 3f011fb -- services/data-api/` empty at the deployed commit `a06d2dc`).
- **DEFERRED (not fabricated) — classes 1–3:** the attach→confirm→upload chain, the Postgres `evidence` +
  `evidence_added` rows, and the Evidence-tab render need a **signed-in SPA session** driving a real upload —
  not self-drivable here (no mintable staff token; processing a real file is the operator's action). Close by
  attaching a file in the deployed SPA assistant, confirming the card, and capturing the API response + the
  `evidence`/`evidence_added` rows + the Evidence-tab render.
- **Provisional:** subscription still FreeTrial (PAYG/A1 outstanding).

## Verdict update — 2026-07-10 (final sweep, ticket-verifier dispatch; transcribed verbatim)

**PENDING — standing gap re-confirmed; deployment surface healthy, fresh negative probe captured.** `uploadCaseEvidence` + `evidenceContent` in the live fn list; unauthenticated upload → **401** re-captured today; the served bundle carries the attach UX strings ("I can only add photos and PDFs to a case.", "the limit is 15 MB", the confirm-card "files to"). Remaining (classes 1–3, operator-shaped): the live attach→confirm→upload chain (API response, `evidence` row + `evidence_added` 100000049 audit, Evidence-tab render) — needs a signed-in session driving a real file. Queued SQL: `count(*) FROM audit_event WHERE action_code=100000049` — non-zero means an operator already ran the chain. Verified by: ticket-verifier dispatch, 2026-07-10.

### W7 data-pass result (orchestrator-run, 2026-07-10)
Confirmed unexercised: **0** `evidence_added` (100000049) audits — the attach→confirm→upload chain
has never run live. The signed-in file-drive remains the sole gap.

## Reopened verdict — 2026-07-13

FAILED (live regression) — four selected image files produced “That file was not added. Try it again,”
and the assistant received filenames rather than image content, so it could not read the visible
registration or identify the case. Earlier auth/route proofs remain useful but do not satisfy the expanded
acceptance.

### How to re-verify

Run the multimodal request-shape, case-resolution and upload integration suites, then repeat the supplied
signed-in scenario only when genuine operator-designated case work needs the image added. Capture the model
request/response within the approved configured-assistant boundary, the confirmation card, upload response,
evidence and audit rows, case preview, classification/archive outcomes and the zero-write result after
cancelling genuine pending work. Do not create a live case or evidence solely for verification.
