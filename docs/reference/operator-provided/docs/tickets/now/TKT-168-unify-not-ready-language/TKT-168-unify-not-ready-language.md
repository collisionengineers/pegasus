# Make Not Ready status language agree with the queue

## Problem
The live Not Ready queue contains a generic status badge and reason filter labelled “Needs review”. That tells a handler both that the case is not ready and that it needs review, even though Review is a separate queue reserved for cases that could theoretically be sent to EVA. The two labels describe mutually exclusive workflow states.

## Evidence
- [Live queue screenshot](./evidence-manifest.json) — Not Ready is selected while the reason chip and several row badges say “Needs review”.
- [Second supplied screenshot](./evidence-manifest.json) — confirms the same contradiction across multiple rows.
- `apps/web/src/shared/ui/StatusBadge.tsx` maps the stored `needs_review` status directly to the rendered label “Needs review”.
- TKT-130 defines Review as the fully ready queue and Not Ready as the home for missing or unresolved requirements.

## Proposed change
Keep the stored status value for continuity, but translate it into the canonical handler-facing workflow language. A generic `needs_review` case must display “Not ready” wherever it appears as a case status or Not Ready reason. More specific blocker labels such as “Missing fields” and “Missing images” remain specific. Field-level review provenance is a different concept and is not renamed by this ticket.

## Acceptance
- A case in the Not Ready queue never displays “Needs review” as its case status, reason, filter, count or action wording.
- The stored `needs_review` case status renders as “Not ready” in the queue, case detail and any shared case-status component.
- Specific statuses continue to render their useful reason, including “Missing fields”, “Missing images”, “Duplicate risk” and “Error”.
- Review remains the only handler-facing label for the queue of cases that pass the canonical EVA readiness predicate.
- The change does not rename field-level provenance/review states or alter persisted status codes.
- Queue reason counts and filtering continue to use the underlying status value while displaying the corrected label.
- Component tests cover the shared status label and the Not Ready reason/filter presentation; a rendered-copy test prevents the contradictory phrase returning on case-status surfaces.
- Live Chrome verification proves the Not Ready queue, affected rows and a case detail no longer show the contradictory status, while Review membership remains unchanged.
- “Not ready” is a state, not a substitute for the reason. Every affected row and case detail shows the most
  specific current blocker available (for example “Missing fields”, with the missing fields named when
  opened); the generic label is used only when no more specific reason exists.
- When several blockers apply, the summary is deterministic, the full set is discoverable, and filtering by
  one blocker neither hides nor rewrites the others.

## Validation

- A status/reason matrix covers each canonical blocker alone and in combination, asserting queue label,
  row badge, detail text, filter membership and accessible name from the same data.
- Signed-in live proof samples at least one generic earlier row and one row per available specific blocker,
  confirming the UI names what is actually preventing readiness and contains no contradictory “Needs review”.

## Research
Distilled 2026-07-13 from the operator's live screenshots and the binding queue semantics in TKT-130. This is a language-consistency repair, not a new lifecycle state.
