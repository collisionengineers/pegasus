# Registration-recognition model research + bench

## Problem
Research vehicle-registration recognition models and **compare the best** options (the reg-OCR half of the
image MVP).

## Evidence
A plate-OCR path already exists (the retained OCR Function / `fast-alpr` plate route); this ticket is the
model-comparison research to pick the best reg-recognition approach feeding the image-analysis sequence
(TKT-016) and document parsing's registration field (TKT-001). See the research pack.

## Proposed change
Benchmark candidate reg-recognition models on representative plate images; recommend the best for the
image-analysis pipeline.

## Acceptance
A short benchmark + recommendation comparing the candidate models on accuracy/cost/latency.
