# Combine email + intake overviews into one compact dashboard

## Problem
The e-mail overview and the intake overview are separate. Combine them into a single **compact,
non-cluttered** dashboard, pushing the more specific controls onto their own pages.

## Evidence
The case dashboard and the inbox dashboard are currently distinct surfaces; the count contract for the
combined view needs pinning down (TKT-012 owns the count semantics). See the research pack.

## Proposed change
Design one amalgamated dashboard that joins the case pipeline summary with inbound-email triage at a
glance, with drill-downs to the dedicated pages for detail and controls.

## Acceptance
A single dashboard shows both email and intake state compactly; specific actions live on their own pages;
counts agree with the contract from TKT-012.
